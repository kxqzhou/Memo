# Memo_cocos2d-js
The very first game project I made since beginning college. It's very simple and unpolished, with no graphics or animation.

I wanted to keep the scope small as it would be the first 'game' I made in a long time. It was also meant to help me learn a little bit about Cocos2d-html5 and basic game design / development along the way. 

The original code was written over summer 2016 and can be played at ocf.io/ksczhou/Memo
